It incorporates features like natural language processing, encryption, and cybersecurity advice, making it a versatile tool for both everyday and security-focused tasks.

##Features
**Speech Recognition**: Converts user speech into text commands.
**Text-to-Speech**: Provides vocal responses to user queries.
**Web Searches**: Searches Google and YouTube based on user input.
**Weather Information**: Retrieves and announces current weather conditions.
**News Updates**: Fetches and reads out news headlines from different categories.
**Email Phishing Detection**: Identifies potential phishing attempts in emails.
**URL Legitimacy Check**: Assesses the safety of URLs.
**Password Management**: Checks password strength and generates secure passwords.
**File Encryption/Decryption**: Secures files through encryption and decryption.
**Cybersecurity Tips**: Provides daily tips and advice on cybersecurity practices.
**Event Scheduling**: Allows users to set reminders and alarms.
**Translation Services**: Translates text into various languages.
